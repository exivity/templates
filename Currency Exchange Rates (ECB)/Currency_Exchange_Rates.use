#===================== Introduction ======================#
#
#  This is a template Extractor for obtaining currency 
#  exchange rates. It provides all common currencies to 
#  EUR, which can be used for currency normalisation tasks 
#  in the Exivity Transformer ETL engine.
#
#  No parameters are required to execute.
